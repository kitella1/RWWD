        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>
            McIntire Fruits prides itself on its ability to produce great farm food. Not just the crisp cherries or 
            the fluffy potatoes, but also the freshly cooked food products we turn them into! Sample a scone with our 
            very own clotted cream and strawberry jam; wash it down with a glass of sparkling elderberry wine.

            The farm has been open to the public since 1989. We pride ourselves on welcoming visitors from all over the world,
            despite our firm Scottish roots. There's never been a better time to start picking your own produce.

            Our family of staff pride themselves on delivering excellent education to both adult and child alike. 
            Bring your family to the berry bonanza weekend or consider attending an evening gin pressing class (adult only).
