            If you are a business looking to work with McIntire Fruits then we'd love to hear from you. 
            We are an ever-expanding brand and are keen to make the most of every opportunity that comes knocking.

        <p>You can find our Farming Policy below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We employ methods of pest control that are humane and reduce the need to apply pesticides. 
            These include but are not limited to the use of natural predators in the strawberry/raspberry fields and pheromone traps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Weeds are managed using a combination of mulch and hand weeding. We do not use herbicides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our farm is designed to encourage wildlife and support its growth within our site. The fields and orchards all have grass alleyways to act as insect corridors, allowing them to pass between crops.
            </li>
            <li>
                Soil is regularly aerated and analysed to reduce the frequency and intensity of soil deficiencies with minimal waste. Mechanical methods are applied to aerate the soil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Environmentally friendly methods of water usage are employed to reduce the amount of water usage that occurs site-wide. Moisture levels are closely monitored to avoid further wastage.
            </li>
            <li>
                We use renewable peat created from coconut fibre. This is not wasted and is reused in other areas of the farm rather than go to landfill.
            </li>
